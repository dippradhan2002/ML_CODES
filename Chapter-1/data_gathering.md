# DATA GATHERING: The Foundation of Every ML Project

Data gathering marks the pivotal first step in any machine learning endeavor. To embark on this journey smoothly, consider these essential checkpoints:

1. [**Install Essential Libraries (ch_1.1)**:](https://github.com/dippradhan2002/ML_CODES/blob/main/Chapter-1/ch_1.1.py)
     Begin by equipping yourself with the necessary tools. Install Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to handle data efficiently.

2. [**Import Essential Libraries (ch_1.2)**:](https://github.com/dippradhan2002/ML_CODES/blob/main/Chapter-1/ch_1.2.py)
     Import these libraries into your workspace. These powerhouses streamline data manipulation, preprocessing, and modeling tasks.

3. [**Data Access (ch_1.3)**:](https://github.com/dippradhan2002/ML_CODES/blob/main/Chapter-1/ch_1.3.py)
     Simplify data access by uploading datasets to platforms like Google Drive. This approach ensures seamless integration into your working directory, facilitating easy retrieval and management.

By adhering to these checkpoints, you lay a robust foundation for your machine learning project. Efficient data handling from the outset sets the stage for insightful analysis and impactful model outcomes.
